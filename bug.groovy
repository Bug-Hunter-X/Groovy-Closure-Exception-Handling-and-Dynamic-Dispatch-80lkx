```groovy
def myMethod(Closure closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  closure()
  println "After closure execution"
}

myMethod { 
  // Some code that throws an exception
  println "Inside closure"
}
```
This code demonstrates a common issue with exception handling within closures in Groovy.  If the closure throws an exception, the "After closure execution" message won't be printed, making it difficult to debug.  The exception might not be caught unless explicitly handled within the closure itself.

Another uncommon issue could involve the interaction between closures and dynamic dispatch.  If a closure relies on methods that are overridden in subclasses, unexpected behavior can arise. In this case, the closure might not behave as expected if called upon an object of the subclass.
