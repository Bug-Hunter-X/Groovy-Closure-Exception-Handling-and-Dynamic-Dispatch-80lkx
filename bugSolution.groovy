```groovy
def myMethod(Closure closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  try {
    closure()
  } catch (Exception e) {
    println "Exception in closure: ${e.message}"
  }
  println "After closure execution"
}

myMethod { 
  // Some code that throws an exception
  println "Inside closure"
  throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!")
}

// Addressing Dynamic Dispatch Issues (Example)
class BaseClass {
  def myMethod() { println "BaseClass myMethod" }
}

class SubClass extends BaseClass {
  def myMethod() { println "SubClass myMethod" }
}

def useClosure(BaseClass obj, Closure c) {
  c.delegate = obj // Explicitly set the delegate to avoid unexpected behavior
  c()
}

def myClosure = { myMethod() }

useClosure(new BaseClass(), myClosure)
useClosure(new SubClass(), myClosure)
```
The improved code adds a `try-catch` block within `myMethod` to handle exceptions thrown by the closure more gracefully.  For the dynamic dispatch issue, explicitly setting the `delegate` of the closure ensures the correct method is called.
